# Predictive-Analysis-Heart-Disease- December 2021

This project was completed as part of the Statistics 101C- Introduction to Statistical Models and Data Mining course. The FinalProject.Rmd file contains some of the code used to generate the results discussed in the PDF report. The project was a Kaggle competition within the students of the course to see who could get the highest accuracy in predictions, and the code was graded based on both accuracy and complexity. The code in this repository produced a high ranking score in the competition.

The goal of the project was to determine which variables are most significant in predicting whether or not a patient develops heart disease or not, and what statistical model should be used in order to best accomplish this goal. We found that a logistic regression model was most effective, and other models tried include KNN, SVM, and XGBoost.

The final model achieved a training accuracy of 0.814 and a testing accuracy of 0.808.
